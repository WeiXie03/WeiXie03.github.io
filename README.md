# Hugo Simple Theme
Welcome to my personal website! I use a very simple and lightweight Hugo Theme inspired by the geniuses behind [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) and enhanced by the genius [Brian Chen](https://chenbrian.ca).


## Features
- Embed video with `{{< video src="video.webm">}}`. Note that only .webm files are supported but this is easily extended.
- Embed pdf with `{{< pdf src="pdf_file.pdf">}}`.
- Insert a table of contents with `{{< toc>}}`.
- Latex support with `katex: true` in header.
- Add a 'back to top' button with `back_to_top: true` in header.

## Configuration
Check [github.com/ihasdapie/chenbrian.ca/](github.com/ihasdapie/chenbrian.ca/) for a working and reasonably documented example.
